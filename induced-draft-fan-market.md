<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Induced Draft Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial</li><li>Radial</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Induced Draft Fans are categorized primarily into three types based on their design and airflow principles. Axial fans move air parallel to the fan axis, providing high airflow with low pressure. Radial fans, or centrifugal fans, move air perpendicular to the fan axis, generating higher pressure and efficiency for various applications. Centrifugal fans, a specific type of radial fan, utilize a rotating impeller to increase air velocity, making them suitable for industrial processes requiring robust air movement.</p></p>
